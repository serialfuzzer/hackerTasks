# hackerTasks
hackerTasks is a checklist of the tasks you need to perform when attacking a web application. The checklist is copied from https://github.com/1lastBr3ath/tasks & http://mdsec.net/wahh/tasks.html.

# Key Features
- Checklist is an instance of a website, you can have multiple websites and their own instance of checklist.
- The checklist stores checked task into a mysql database making the checklist persistent.
- The application is responsive, the app should look good in most screen sizes.
- The application supports login and registration

# Installation
  The application should be installed and running quite easily in linux operating systems if you already have Docker, docker-compose, Node.js  and npm installed. However, if you don't have Node.js and npm already installed, you can [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it.
  
  Commands to install all the required dependencies
  
  1. git clone https://github.com/TheN008/hackerTasks.git && cd hackerTasks
  2. sudo docker-compose up --build

After running these two commands, hackerTasks should be up and running at port 31337. Go to your browser and open http://localhost:31337 and it will open. 
  
  
# Update

Due to recent peak in insights and continuous downloads of this project, I've decided to enhance it a little bit.
In the next few days or weeks I'll be dockerising this repository and I will be improving it a bit.
